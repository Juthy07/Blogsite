/*
The export statement is used in Javascript modules to export functions, objects, or primitive values from 
one module so that they can be used in other programs.

A module encapsulates related code into a single unit of code. 
All functions related to a single module are contained in a file.

Module exports are the instructions that tell Node.js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) 
to export from a given file so that other files are allowed to access the exported code.
